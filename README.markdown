# A tinder date with ReasonML

Slides accompanying my longer format talk introducing ReasonML, Reason-React, Create-Reason-React and more.

>What is Reason, and why does it seem to keep dripping into our React ecosystem? Is this just one of those crazy hipster things? Should I learn it now, later, or never at all? These questions and more will be answered in this talk.
